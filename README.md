# Credit Card Default Prediction

This project is a solution designed for predicting credit card defaults using machine learning models. It allows users to input customer details such as credit limit, gender, education level, marital status, age, payment status, and bill amounts. The backend of the application runs machine learning models, including Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost, to predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on their credit card payments. The frontend displays the prediction results, including the prediction itself and the probability of default. This project is useful for banks, financial institutions, and credit card companies to assess the risk of potential defaults among their customers.

## Data Source
- The dataset used in this project is a part of the UCI Machine Learning Repository named "Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset" is obtained from Kaggle.
- This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005.
